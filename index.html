        <div class="par">The wings are back. On Tuesday, the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show made a splashy return after a six-year hiatus, painting Brooklyn the brand’s signature pink. So how did it revive the old-school grandeur? The brand’s takeover of the Brooklyn Navy Yard included an icon-filled runway show featuring top models like Gigi Hadid, OG Angels Tyra Banks and Adriana Lima, and legends such as Kate Moss and Carla Bruni, who made their VS fashion-show debut. The night also featured A-list performances from Lisa, Tyla, and the one and only Cher.

        <div class="par">Yes, the 2024 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show had everything: Cher, motorcycles, a surprise appearance from Bella Hadid, ornate wings, and even a fashionably late Cardi B. Here are highlights from the 2024 Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show.</div>
        <br>

        <h2>Gigi Hadid Opened the Show</h2><br>

                <div class="bio">Gigi Hadid’s opening walk had full “we’re back” energy. The model walked the runway in a pink plunge silk teddy and, of course, a pair of wide-feathered electronic wings that expanded as the model strutted the stage.</div>

            <h2>Lisa and Tyla Performed</h2><br>

                <div class="bio">If there’s one thing the Victoria’s Secret show got right, it was this year’s performances. K-pop sensation and Blackpink alum Lisa revved up her engine on the runway, opening the show on a motorcycle with a fleet of leather-clad dancers. Later in the show, Tyla brought the heat, looking like a sparkling angel in an embellished lingerie set and soft, fluffy wings.</div>

                <div class="bio">OG Angel Adriana Lima made her big return to the Victoria’ Secret show, rocking the runway with a high pony and wearing a black strappy bra and underwear set with a pink-and-black gingham arm and leg overlay.</div>
